        Your personal information at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">The data we hold about you, your rights and how to contact us about it.</p>

      <p>Under the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the right to request copies of your, or someone else’s, personal data from organisations, including government departments. The Act gives you rights over that data, including making sure it is correct, how it should be handled and when it should be deleted.
</p>
<p>You can find full details of our obligations under the data protection laws in our information charter:</p>

<p>We are also working on ways to improve the process for anyone wanting to contact the MOJ about personal data.</p>
<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Your rights and how to exercise them</h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">For your personal data, you have the right to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be informed about what we do with your personal information</li>
        <li>request copies of your personal information we hold about you </li>
        <li>rectification (correcting errors)</li>
        <li>erasure</li>
        <li>restrict processing</li>
        <li>data processing</li>
        <li>data portability</li>
        <li>object</li>
        <li>not be subjected to automated decision-making, including profiling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve set out below your rights and how to contact the MOJ for each of these rights.</p>
      <p>The process for contacting us about the first right listed, the right to request copies of your personal information, is a different process than when contacting us about all the other rights. This is because different types of information will be held in different parts of the department.</p>
    <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Right to request copies of your personal information</h1>
    <p>This is known as the ‘right of subject access’, and a request for a copy of your personal information is called a ‘subject access request’, or SAR.</p>
    <p>If we do hold information about you, we will:</P>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>give you a description of it</li>
        <li>tell you why we have it</li>
        <li>tell you who it could be given to</li>
        <li>provide the information in a readable format</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Any subject access request must include 2 things:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>A description of where your personal data may be held. Tell us where in the department your personal data may be held. It will help us to find your records. For example, tell us which court or prison you have had business with, including any relevant case reference numbers and dates. Please be as specific as possible.</li>
        <li>Valid identification</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="govuk-body">Acceptable forms of ID include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a photocopy of your passport or driving licence</li>
        <li>an electricity bill (a copy of the original bill)</li>
        <li>a gas bill (a copy of the original bill)</li>
        <li>a council tax bill (a copy of the original bill</li>
        <li>any other bill in your full name (a copy of the original bill)</li>
        <p class="govuk-body">Any bill you send must be less than 6 months old.</p>
        <p>Making a SAR is normally free. But we may charge you a fee if it is excessive.</p>
